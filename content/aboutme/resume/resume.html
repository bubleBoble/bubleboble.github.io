        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            I am primarily interested in embedded engineering. I have a strong interest in the C programming language
            and its related tools, including
            build automation systems. I am proficient in using Git for source control and am well-versed in
            managing shared codebases, as well as strategies for collaboration between multiple developers.
            Additionally, I am experienced with the GNU/Linux environment and tools like Bash scripting,
            and I use Fedora Linux as my daily operating system. In the near future, I aim to focus more
            on embedded Linux development, particularly with technologies like Yocto and Buildroot, and on
            Linux drivers development.

            <h4>Soft:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I like to keep things organized—whether it's naming conventions in code, sticking
                to a consistent style, or keeping my Git workflow neat and tidy. I'm also all about learning
                from others and collaborating. I try to avoid the "impostor syndrome" and stay open to picking
                up new skills from those around me.

            <p>
                Developed embedded software and hardware for HVAC appliances as part
                of the R&D team. Worked with technologies including STM32,
                CubeIDE, C, C++, Python, CMake, Make, Linux, Git, and KiCad.
                Performed extensive debugging and troubleshooting. Collaborated
                closely with the cloud development team on the IoT product's cloud
                integration. Familiarized myself with containerization technologies,
                starting with Docker and later transitioning to Podman, as required
                by the product.

                I had a chance to learn about their product (Session Border
                Controller - SBC), while improving my networking and Linux
                skills by working with VMs, remote labs, and a bit with Docker.
                I worked with both legacy C code for the product application
                and modern C++ code for Google Tests and utility apps. I also
                used Bash scripting and Python mainly for testing purposes, and
                managed version control with Git.

                <b>Final project:</b> I developed and implemented a linear inverted pendulum
                control system on the STM32F4 development platform. Technologies and skills
                I used include: C programming, FreeRTOS, Python, MATLAB, basic electronics,
                and machining. The main application was written in C. I used MATLAB and Python,
                along with several libraries, for the mathematical modeling and simulation
                parts of the project.
